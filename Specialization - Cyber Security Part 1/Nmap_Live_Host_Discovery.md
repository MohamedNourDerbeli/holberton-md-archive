* How to enumerateTargets.
* What is ARP Scan
* What is ICMPEchoScan
* What is ICMP Timestamp Scan

## Requirements

### General

* Allowed editors:vi,vim,emacs.
* All your scripts will be tested onKali Linux.
* All your scripts should be exactly two lines long ($ wc -l fileshould print 2)
* You must substitute the IP range for$1.
* All your files should end with a new line (Why?)
* The first line of all your files should be exactly#!/bin/bash.
* AREADME.mdfile, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* You are not allowed to use backticks,&&,||or;.
* Your code should use theBettystyle. It will be checked usingbetty-style.plandbetty-doc.pl
* All your files must be executable
* Ensure that$1is used without quotes in your script to prevent unintended argument type alterations.


## Tasks

### 0.  Will arp be enough ?

### 7.  Simple Catch, is it mimicked ?

Time To PingThe Target(cybernetsec_0x04)

Catch the flag time is on, here is some tips:

* You should run your scan as privileged user.rootorsudoers.
* The Current Flag is hidden withinUDPopened port serviceVERSION
* Two hundred, Three hundred but no more.-p200-300
