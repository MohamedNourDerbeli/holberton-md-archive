## Tasks

### 0. Manual Discovery - Secrets in Plain Sight

Your goal is to uncover a hidden flag by thoroughly exploring the site‚Äôs structure.

Use all available discovery methods, including analyzing files such asrobots.txt,sitemap.xml, andfavicon.ico

1 . Sitemap Exploration

Start by reviewing the sitemap located at/sitemap.xml. The sitemap may reveal unusual or hidden routes not linked from anywhere else on the site.

One of these routes contains your flag.

2 . Additional Discovery

Investigate any common files such asrobots.txtorfavicon.ico, as they may contain further clues or hidden paths.

* Target Machine:Cyber - WebSec 0x04
* Target Endpoint:http://web0x04.hbtn/

```bash
Useful Instructions
1.Start by navigating to /robots.txt. Look for any Disallow entries that might hint at hidden or restricted paths. These paths could lead to interesting or hidden resources.
2.Access /sitemap.xml. Sitemaps are used to help search engines index web content, but they may also reveal hidden resources. Find the resource that is not linked from anywhere else on the site to discover your flag.
3.Download the site's favicon.ico and analyze it using tools or online resources like the OWASP favicon database. By matching the favicon to known frameworks, you might uncover more information about the site.
4.Pay close attention to details in each file. Each file could contain direct paths or subtle hints that lead to the next step in your discovery process.
5.Utilize online tools for favicon analysis and comparison to help identify the framework and speed up your search for hidden resources.

### 1.  Manual Discovery - Headers, Headers, Always Check Headers

HTTP Headers often hide secrets ü§´.In this task, you‚Äôll meticulously inspect HTTP response headers to unearth a hiddenFlag‚õ≥Ô∏è.This requires a keen eye and an understanding of how developers might conceal information within the HTTP protocol.

* Target Machine:Cyber - WebSec 0x04
* Target Endpoint:http://web0x04.hbtn/

```bash
Useful Instructions
1. Utilize `curl`, browser developer tools, or similar tools to examine the complete set of HTTP response headers returned from the target endpoint.
2. Do not overlook non-standard headers; the flag may be tucked away within a custom or uncommon header field.
3. Be aware that servers can dynamically alter headers based on the request's nature. Vary your request type, user-agent, and other headers to provoke different responses.
4. Certain headers might appear only under specific circumstances (e.g., receiving error codes or when making requests with unique headers). Adjust your requests to explore these possibilities.

### 8. The Buster Series - Tackling TFTP with Brute Force `tftp mode`

Your final challenge in the Gobuster series focuses on thetftpmode,a specialized approach aimed at brute-forcing filenames on servers using the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP).TFTP servers are commonly used for booting network devices or for simple file transfers in environments where security is not a primary concern.However, misconfigured or unauthorized TFTP servers can expose sensitive information or system files to an attacker.You‚Äôll leverage this mode to find afilethat contains aFlag‚õ≥Ô∏è.

* Target Machine:Cyber - WebSec 0x04
* Target Host:web0x04.hbtn

```bash
Instructions
1. Given the nature of TFTP, compile a wordlist of common system configuration filenames, bootloader files, or backup file names that might exist on a TFTP server.
2. Use Gobuster‚Äôs `tftp` mode to enumerate files on the target TFTP server.
3. Be attentive to successful hits in Gobuster‚Äôs output, which can indicate the existence of a file on the server. Each found file warrants further analysis to understand its contents and implications.
4. Compile a list of discovered files, offering insights into any potentially sensitive data or system information they might reveal.Remember:
- TFTP does not support authentication by default, making it inherently insecure. Ensure that your testing is authorized and does not disrupt the target environment.
- Brute-forcing a server can lead to network congestion or server performance issues. Conduct your tests responsibly and consider the impact on the target server and network.
