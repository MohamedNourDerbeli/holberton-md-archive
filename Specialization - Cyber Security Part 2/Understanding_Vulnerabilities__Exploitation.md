# Project: Understanding Vulnerabilities  (Exploitation)

## Description

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to  explain to anyone,without the help of Google:

Objective:  The goal of this exercise is to conduct a security assessment on a vulnerable Windows machine using various tools and techniques. You will use Nmap to discover the machine, Nessus to identify vulnerabilities, NVD to research a specific CVE, Metasploit to exploit the vulnerability, and finally, extract and crack the password hashes.

Deliverable:  Provide a full report with all answers to the questions below. Additionally, you need to submit the flag found inside the machine along with the cracked passwords for both the user and administrator.

Setup The Virtual Machine

Hint

To successfully complete this project, you must use a Kali Linux VM for all the tasks. Additionally, it’s essential to interact with and manipulate the Holberton VM as part of the required exercises. Make sure you have both VMs properly configured and running to perform the necessary actions and exploit techniques.

## Learning Objectives

* How to exploit Vulnerabilities .
* The difference between the two types of vulnerability and their score.
* Gain a comprehensive understanding of vulnerabilities in software and systems.
* Learn definitions and types of vulnerabilities.
* Understand methods to detect vulnerabilities.
* Learn best practices to mitigate vulnerabilities.
* Identify various vulnerabilities.
* Understand the implications of different vulnerabilities.
* Apply detection methods effectively.


## Requirements

### General

* Allowed editors:vi,vim,emacs.
* All your scripts will be tested onKali Linux.
* All your scripts should be exactly two lines long ($ wc -l fileshould print 2)
* You must substitute the IP range for$1.
* All your files should end with a new line (Why?)
* The first line of all your files should be exactly#!/bin/bash.
* AREADME.mdfile, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Ensure that$1is used without quotes in your script to prevent unintended argument type alterations.


## Tasks

### 0. Discovery with Nmap

Identify the target machine  Using Nmap

Share Your Codebase and Response For The bellow Question 
 you need to save the Nmap scan report inside the 0-nmap.md file.

Questions

PS: Respond to Those in Readme That have same name and id as script  Share Both Script and response to question  as well provide screenshot if necessary

* What IP address is the target machine using?
* What open ports and services did you discover on the target machine?
* What is the operating system identified by Nmap?

* File:0-nmap.sh,0-nmap.md

### 1. Vulnerability Assessment with Nessus

Scan the target machine using Nessus:

Questions

* Perform a full vulnerability scan on the target IP.
* Identify the  vulnerability in the scan results.

* What vulnerabilities were identified on the target machine?
* Provide a summary of the  vulnerability as reported by Nessus.

* GitHub repository:holbertonschool-cyber_security
* Directory:vulnerability_research_exploitation/0x00_vulnerability
* File:nessus_rapport.csv

### 2. CVE Research Using NVD

Research the MS17-010 vulnerability

Questions

* Use the NVD (National Vulnerability Database) to find detailed information on
CVE-2017-0144 (MS17-010).

* What is the CVE ID for the vulnerability?
* Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability.
* What is the CVSS score for this vulnerability?
* What are the potential impacts of exploiting this vulnerability?
* Are there any known mitigations or patches available for this vulnerability?

* File:2-ms_17_010.md

### 3. Exploitation with Metasploit

Exploit the vulnerability using Metasploit

Metasploit  Steps :

* Identify and exploit the MS17-010 vulnerability using Metasploit.
* Select the correct exploit module and configure it appropriately.
* Execute the exploit and establish a Meterpreter session.
* Navigate to the Administrator’s Desktop.
* Identify and analyze files that may contain critical information or instructions for further actions.
* Follow any instructions found during enumeration to execute relevant files or commands.
* Retrieve and Document the Flag

* Directory:vulnerability_research_exploitation/0x00_vulnerability
* File:flag.txt

### 4. Post-Exploitation and Password Extraction

Extract password hashes

* Use Metasploit’s post-exploitation modules to dump password hashes from the
target machine.
* Save the extracted hashes for the Administrator and Holderton _ simpleuser to cracke it in the next task  in 4-password_extraction.txt

**Repo Info:**
