## Tasks

### 0. Skipping NSE scripting for Nmap is like bringing a spoon to a hacking knife fight!



You might be familiar with the robust open-source network scanning tool Nmap, but have you heard about the even more potent Nmap Scripting Engine?

The Nmap Scripting EngineNSEis an advanced feature of the open-source network scanning toolNmap. It automates network scanning and exploitation tasks, saving time and enhancing capabilities through scripting.

We have observed that many security professionals lack the ability to writeNSEscripts forNmap. This skill is relatively easy to learn, and by neglecting it, you are leaving a lot of value on the table. Let‚Äôs dive in and learn everything we need to become experts in the Nmap Scripting Engine today!

Write a bash script that runs the default NSE scripts usingdefaultto perform various analyses and gather necessary information related to the target.

Depending on the scanned network, the output could change.

* Your script should accept a host as an arguments$1

```bash

### 1. Using Nmap's vulners script: like finding Easter eggs, but with cyber threats!

Nmap‚Äôs vulners script is a powerful tool for identifying vulnerabilities on a target host. By leveraging a comprehensive database of known vulnerabilities, this script scans specified ports and services, providing detailed information about potential security issues.

Using thevulnersscript as part of regular security assessments can help organizations maintain robust defenses against emerging threats and ensure their systems remain secure.

Write a bash script that accepts a host as an argument$1.Run thevulnersscript on the specified host, targeting ports80followed by443.

Depending on the scanned network, the output could change.

### 5. NSE scripts in Nmap: where automation meets network domination!



When utilizing Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE), we harness a powerful capability within Nmap to automate and extend its network scanning functionalities.NSE scripts enable us to perform a wide range of tasks beyond basic port scanning, including service version detection, vulnerability detection, enumeration of specific protocols likeSMBandDNS, and even complex tasks like brute-force attacks and web application scanning.

Writea bash scriptthat performs comprehensive network reconnaissance using Nmap with specific NSE scripts:

Depending on the scanned network, the output could change.



* Your script should accepta hostas an arguments$1
* Your script should probe open ports to determine service/version information.
* Your script should enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
* Your script shouldsequentiallyexecute multiple NSE scripts to detect vulnerabilities across various services:Retrieve service banners from open ports.Enumerate supportedSSL/TLSciphers..Run default scriptsdefaultdefined by Nmap for basic enumeration tasks.EnumerateSMB(Server Message Block) domains.
* Retrieve service banners from open ports.
* Enumerate supportedSSL/TLSciphers..
* Run default scriptsdefaultdefined by Nmap for basic enumeration tasks.
* EnumerateSMB(Server Message Block) domains.
* Save the output toservice_enumeration_results.txtfor later analysis.
