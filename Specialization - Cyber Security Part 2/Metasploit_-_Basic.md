## Learning Objectives

* Familiarize with basic Metasploit commands and workflow to understand how to search for exploits, set payloads, and execute them.
* Learn how to create a simple payload using msfvenom and understand the process of generating and validating payload files
* Understand how to search for, configure, and use auxiliary modules in Metasploit, specifically focusing on performing a TCP port scan.
* Set up and use PostgreSQL with Metasploit to manage data more efficiently, including creating and configuring the database and verifying the connection.
* Learn how to document findings and create reports in Metasploit by using notes and loot commands to store data and generate comprehensive reports.


## Requirements

### General

* Allowed editors:vi,vim,emacs.
* All your scripts will be tested onKali Linux.
* All your scripts should be exactly two lines long ($ wc -l fileshould print 2)
* You must substitute the IP range for$1.
* All your files should end with a new line (Why?)
* The first line of all your files should be exactly#!/bin/bash.
* AREADME.mdfile, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* You are not allowed to use backticks,&&,||or;.
* Your code should use theBettystyle. It will be checked usingbetty-style.plandbetty-doc.pl
* All your files must be executable
* Ensure that$1is used without quotes in your script to prevent unintended argument type alterations.


## Tasks
