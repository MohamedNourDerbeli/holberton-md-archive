# Project: Active Directory - Exploitation

## Description

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able toexplain to anyone,without the help of Google:

Needed ISOS:

Note: You must create two virtual machines in the same network one will be a user machine and
the other will be the domain controller

*Share Screen Shot of Every Step in The Project *

## Learning Objectives

* How can you identify attack surfaces in Active Directory (AD)?
* How does Kerberos authentication work in Active Directory, and what techniques are used for Kerberoasting, Golden Ticket attacks, and Pass-the-Hash (PtH) attacks?
* What are the exploitation techniques that target NTLM authentication vulnerabilities and weaknesses?
* How is Active Directory (AD) structured, including domains, forests, domain controllers, and trust relationships?
* What are Service Principal Names (SPNs), and what role do they play in Windows environments?


## Tasks

### 0. LLMNR Attack

Determine the username and password  using LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) poisoning techniques in The Previous Lab you Setup inActive Directory - Fundamentals

Tools Needed:

Ensure you have two virtual machines From Previous Project

*Keep ScreenShot of Every Step Along With The Command Used *

* Impacket
* Responder
* Hashcat

* VM1: Active Directory server with user accounts set up.
* VM2: User machine joined to the AD domain

**Repo Info:**
### 1. Gaining Shell

Gain access to the user machine  and retrieve the content of a specified file located on the desktop using Metasploit.

Tools Needed:

* Metasploit (msfconsole)

**Repo Info:**
### 2. Dumping Hashes

Retrieve the admin hash password and DPAPI user key from the target machine without using PsExec.

Questions:

Tools Needed:

* What is the admin hash password?
* What is the DPAPI user key?

* Impacket’s secretdump.py

**Repo Info:**
### 3. Simulate a Kerberoasting Attack

Simulate a Kerberoasting attack to identify Service Principal Names (SPNs) and extract the service ticket to crack the password.

Questions:

Tools Needed:

* What is the service name?
* What is the password?

* Impacket’s GetUserSPNs.py
