# Project: Web Application Fast Incident Response

## Description

By the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain the following to anyone,without the help of Google:

What are the stages of web application incident response, and why is each stage important?

How can web application attacks be quickly detected and identified?

What are the effective methods for containing, eradicating, and recovering from web application incidents?

What role does automation play in speeding up incident response?

How should incidents be documented and communicated during response actions?

Why are post-incident reviews significant, and how do they contribute to security improvements?

How can detection and monitoring tools be utilized to identify potential web application incidents?

What skills are necessary for accurately identifying and prioritizing threats in web applications?

How can normal service operations be restored as quickly as possible to minimize the impact on business activities?

## Requirements

### General

* Allowed editors:vi,vim,emacs.
* All your scripts will be tested onKali Linux.
* All your files should end with a new line (Why?)
* The first line of all your files should be exactly#!/bin/bash.
* AREADME.mdfile, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* You are not allowed to use backticks,&&,||or;.
* All your files must be executable
* Ensure that$1is used without quotes in your script to prevent unintended argument type alterations.


## Tasks

### 0.  Identify the Attack Source

Create a Bash script to identify the IP address responsible for the most requests in a log file, which is likely the source of a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

Functionality:

* Extract IP addresses from the log file.
* Count the occurrences of each IP address.
* Identify and print the IP address with the highest number of requests.Log File  :logs.txt
* Log File  :logs.txt

```bash
TIP: see which Ip had the most requests
```

**Repo Info:**
* GitHub repository:holbertonschool-cyber_security
* Directory:web_application_security/0x0b_web_application_fast_incident_response
* File:0-attack_ip.sh

### 1. Identify the Attacked Endpoint

Create a Bash script to find the endpoint (URL) that received the most requests, indicating it was likely the target of the attack.

Functionality:

* Extract the requested URLs from the log file.
* Count the occurrences of each endpoint and identify the most frequently requested one.

```bash
TIP: try to find where the most request have been sent
```

**Repo Info:**
* GitHub repository:holbertonschool-cyber_security
* Directory:web_application_security/0x0b_web_application_fast_incident_response
* File:1-endpoint.sh

### 2.  Count the Number of Requests by the Attacker

Create a Bash script to determine how many requests the attacker has sent, where the attacker is identified as the IP address with the highest number of requests.

Requirements:

* The script should accept a log file as input.
* It should:Identify the IP address with the most requests (assumed to be the attacker).Count the total number of requests made by that IP address.
* Identify the IP address with the most requests (assumed to be the attacker).
* Count the total number of requests made by that IP address.

```bash
┌──(oumaima㉿hbtn-lab)-[…/web_application_security/0x0b_web_application_fast_incident_response]
└─$  ./2-count_attack.sh
5000
```

**Repo Info:**
* GitHub repository:holbertonschool-cyber_security
* Directory:web_application_security/0x0b_web_application_fast_incident_response
* File:2-count_attack.sh

### 3. Identify the Library Used by the Attacker

Create a Bash script to find out which tool or library the attacker used by analyzing the User-Agent strings.

Functionality:

* Filter the log for requests made by the attacker.
* Extract and count the User-Agent strings to identify the tool/library used.

```bash
┌──(oumaima㉿hbtn-lab)-[…/web_application_security/0x0b_web_application_fast_incident_response]
└─$  ./3-library.sh
python-requests/2.31.0
```

**Repo Info:**
* GitHub repository:holbertonschool-cyber_security
* Directory:web_application_security/0x0b_web_application_fast_incident_response
* File:3-library.sh

### 4. Propose a Mitigation Solution

After navigating the complexities ofweb application incidentsyour final task is to compile and present your findings ina detailed incident reportThis report should not only document the attacks and vulnerabilities you encountered during the project tasks but also highlight any additional security weaknesses identified through your investigation.The goal is to createa comprehensive documentthat could be presented to an organization to help them understand the incident and implement the proposed remediation strategies.

Your report should be structured and detailed, adhering to professional standards. Consider using a Google Doc for its collaborative features and accessibility. Here are key elements to include:

```bash
TIP: what is the thing that will limit the usage of the server
```
