# Project: CVE, CWE and NVD

## Description

Read or watch:

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able toexplain to anyone,without the help of Google:

By achieving these learning objectives, individuals and organizations can enhance their ability to identify, assess, and mitigate software vulnerabilities, thereby improving their overall cybersecurity posture.

## Learning Objectives

* What are CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures), and how do they help in identifying and sharing information about publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities?
* What is the structure of a CVE identifier (e.g., CVE-2024-1234), and what is the significance of each part?
* What role do CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs) play in the CVE assignment process, and what are the criteria for becoming a CNA?
* How are vulnerabilities reported, reviewed, and assigned a CVE identifier through the CVE entry process?
* How can you use the CVE database to search for and retrieve information about specific vulnerabilities?
* What are CWEs (Common Weakness Enumeration), and how do they help in identifying common software weaknesses that can lead to vulnerabilities?
* What are the different categories, types, and hierarchical structures of CWEs?
* How are CWEs related to CVEs, and how do they describe the types of weaknesses that lead to vulnerabilities?
* What are some common mitigation techniques and best practices for addressing weaknesses identified by CWEs?
* How can weaknesses be prioritized based on their severity, exploitability, and potential impact using CWE scoring?
* What is the role of the NVD (National Vulnerability Database) in the cybersecurity ecosystem, and how does it support vulnerability management?
* What types of data feeds are provided by the NVD, including vulnerability metrics, configurations, and impact scores?
* How can you use the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) to assess the severity of vulnerabilities listed in the NVD?
* How can you effectively search, filter, and retrieve vulnerability information from the NVD?
* How can NVD data be integrated with security tools and platforms for automated vulnerability management?

How does it contribute to vulnerability management and information sharing?

**Repo Info:**
### 1. Severity in CVE

How does the severity of CVEs affect an organization’s prioritization of security measures?

Provide examples of how different severity levels (low, medium, high, critical) influence response strategies.

**Repo Info:**
### 2. CVE List

Explain the process of assigning CVE IDs to vulnerabilities.

Who manages the CVE List, and what role do CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs) play in this process?

**Repo Info:**
### 3. CVEs Scores

How can organizations use CVEs and CVSS scores effectively to enhance their cybersecurity posture?

Discuss strategies for integrating CVE information into vulnerability management programs

**Repo Info:**
### 4. Calculate CVSS

Calculate and interpret CVSS scores for given vulnerability scenarios

Vulnerability Scenario:A remote code execution vulnerability in a widely used web server software. The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely without requiring authentication.

Calculate the CVSS base score for this vulnerability and determine itsseverity level

CVSS Base Metrics (example):

You can  useCVSS calculator

* Identify the relevant base metrics (Attack Vector, Attack Complexity, Privileges Required, User Interaction, Scope).
* Calculate the base score using the CVSS v3.1 formula (available in the CVSS documentation).
* Discuss the implications of the calculated score, including the severity level (low, medium, high, critical) and potential impact on an organization’s security posture.
* Recommend appropriate mitigation strategies based on the severity level and CVSS  metrics.

* Attack Vector: Network
* Attack Complexity: Low
* Privileges Required: Required
* User Interaction: Required
* Scope: Unchanged
