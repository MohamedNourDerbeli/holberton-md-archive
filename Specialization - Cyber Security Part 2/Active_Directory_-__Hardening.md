# Project: Active Directory -  Hardening

## Description

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able toexplain to anyone,without the help of Google:

Needed ISOS:

Please Finish

Note: You must create two virtual machines in the same network one will be a user machine and
the other will be the domain controller

## Learning Objectives

* Gain a comprehensive understanding of Active Directory (AD) architecture, common security threats, and the principles of securing an AD environment.
* Learn to implement security measures to protect Domain Controllers (DCs) from attacks and vulnerabilities.
* Develop skills to create and manage Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to enforce security policies across the AD environment.
* Understand and apply network security measures to protect the AD infrastructure from network-based attacks.
* Learn to configure advanced auditing and integrate AD logs with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems for improved security monitoring
* Acquire the ability to implement measures to mitigate specific AD attacks and vulnerabilities.
* Learn how LAPS ensures the secure storage of local administrator passwords and complies with best practices for sensitive information handling.
* Develop the ability to configure Group Policy settings for LAPS, including password complexity requirements, expiration policies, and password retrieval settings.
* Understand how LAPS integrates with Active Directory to securely store and retrieve local administrator passwords.
* Learn the role of LAPS in managing local administrator passwords and how it addresses security concerns related to password reuse and exposure.
